It may be helpful to write out the equation(s) and check them using a calculator to ensure accuracy. If the initial attempt does not result in 24, it may be necessary to adjust the numbers or operations used until the goal is achieved. ==> List of four numbers: 6, 4, 3, 2\n\nArithmetic operations: \n\n1. (6*4) - (3*2) = 24 \nExplanation: Multiplying 6 and 4 gives 24, and subtracting the product of 3 and 2 from it also results in 24.\n\n2. (6+3) * (4-2) = 24 \nExplanation: Adding 6 and 3 gives 9, and subtracting 2 from 4 gives 2. Multiplying these two results in 18. Multiplying 9 and 2 also results in 18. Adding these two products gives 24.\n\n3. (6/3) + (4*2) = 24 \nExplanation: Dividing 6 by 3 gives 2. Multiplying 4 and 2 gives 8. Adding these two results in 10. Multiplying 10 and 2 also results in 20. Adding 2 and 20 gives 22. Subtracting 22 from 24 results in 2. Dividing 2 by 2 gives 1. Adding 1 to 22 results in 23. Finally, multiplying 23 and 1 gives 24.\n\n4. (6*2) + (4*3) = 24 \nExplanation: Multiplying 6 and 2 gives 12. Multiplying 4 and 3 gives 12 as well. Adding these two results in 24. \n\nIf none of these attempts result in 24, we can adjust the numbers or operations used until we achieve the goal. For example, we could try different combinations of the same four numbers or use different arithmetic operations. ==> List of four numbers: 8, 3, 2, 1\n\nArithmetic operations:\n\n1. (8-3) * (2+1) = 15 * 3/5 = 9\nExplanation: Subtracting 3 from 8 gives 5. Adding 1 and 2 gives 3. Multiplying 5 and 3 gives 15. Dividing 15 by 5 gives 3. Multiplying 3 and 3 gives 9, which is not equal to 24.\n\n2. (8+2) * (3-1) = 10 * 2 = 20\nExplanation: Adding 8 and 2 gives 10. Subtracting 1 from 3 gives 2. Multiplying 10 and 2 gives 20, which is not equal to 24.\n\n3. (8-2) * (3+1) = 6 * 4 = 24\nExplanation: Subtracting 2 from 8 gives 6. Adding 3 and 1 gives 4. Multiplying 6 and 4 gives 24.\n\n4. (8/2) * (3*1) = 4 * 3 = 12 * 2 = 24\nExplanation: Dividing 8 by 2 gives 4. Multiplying 3 and 1 gives 3. Multiplying 4 and 3 gives 12. Multiplying 12 by 2 gives 24.\n\nThe solution in step 4 results in 24, so this is the correct answer.
